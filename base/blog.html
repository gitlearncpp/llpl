  <h1>personal blog - my journey with Low-Level Languages</h1>

  -------------------------------------------------------<br>
  -------------------------------------------------------<br>

  <h2>prologue - first post</h2>
  The goal I have set for myself is to learn programming in low-level languages. <br>
  For some time, I have been learning
  languages like Python and Java, but I have realized that the most intriguing
  and exciting are the low-level languages.<br>
  On this blog, I want to share my experiences, ups and downs (which will
  undoubtedly be plenty).
  While browsing forums and Reddit, I encountered various strategies.

  <h3>strategy one</h3> Start with C++, you will learn C along the way, then
  check the differences between C and C++.

  <h3>strategy two, my choice </h3>Learn C first, then C++, and finally Assembler.
  <h3>strategy three, my choice</h3> First, learn Python well, then move on
  to other languages.<br><br>

  <b>Why this choice? </b><br> <br>

  Of course, learning programming <b>would be useless </b>if I didn't
  simultaneously start reading about how computers and
  operating systems work. I intend to do this while also refreshing my
  knowledge of mathematics and physics from my
  university years.<br><br>

  <h2>first week</h2>
  What I've done: I recalled the basics of Python and writing in this language.
  I reviewed the principles of object-oriented programming. Additionally,
  <b>I prepared the application</b> insurance.llpl.org.pl, which aims to calculate
  the home insurance price based on property variables. <br>
  Developed using
  <b>object-oriented programming and the Flask framework and PostgreSQL</b>. <br>
  The application is
  available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gitlearncpp/insurance.llpl">link</a> . <br></br>Additionally, the application <b>has been deployed </b>to
  a production environment. <b>Fedora server</b>, using <b>Nginx and Gunicorn</b>.<br>
  I struggled a bit with the configuration during deployment, but it worked out.
  I did not create the application's frontend; it is available via an API.<br><br>
  <h2>example:</h2>
  <b>Endpoint</b>: http://57.129.16.48/calculate_price <br>
