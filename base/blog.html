  <h1>personal blog - my journey with Low-Level Languages</h1>

  -------------------------------------------------------<br>
  -------------------------------------------------------<br>

  <h2>prologue - first post</h2>
  The goal I have set for myself is to learn programming in low-level languages. <br>
  For some time, I have been learning
  languages like Python and Java, but I have realized that the most intriguing and exciting are the low-level languages.<br>
  On this blog, I want to share my experiences, ups and downs (which will undoubtedly be plenty).
  While browsing forums and Reddit, I encountered various strategies.
  <h3>strategy one</h3> First, learn Python well, then move on to other languages.
  <h3>strategy two</h3> Start with C++, you will learn C along the way, then check the differences between C and C++.
  <h3>strategy three, my choice </h3>Learn C first, then C++, and finally Assembler. I decided to follow this path.<br><br>
  <b>Why this choice? </b><br> <br>

</br>Firstly, I understand the concept of mastering a high-level language first and then moving downwards.<br>
  <b>However</b>, I feel it's a waste of time to spend a year or two learning a language since I intend to use others.
  The second decision was whether to start with C or C++. Some say to start with C++ because it's harder, and C
  will come naturally.<br><br>
  I know a bit of C and C++ (functional basics in C++ and functions in C), and I don't think this is the best path.<br>
  Many C++ libraries are written in C; however, learning C++, I want to understand the libraries...<br>
  <b>Additionally</b>, C is smaller in volume, quicker to learn than C++. That's why I plan to follow this sequence: C, C++.<br>
  Assembler - if I find myself comfortable in C and C++. I haven't decided on Assembler plans yet; I don't know which
  processors it will be for. Probably, by learning the previous languages, I will organize this information.<br>
  Of course, learning programming <b>would be useless </b>if I didn't simultaneously start reading about how computers and
  operating systems work. I intend to do this while also refreshing my knowledge of mathematics and physics from my
  university years.<br><br>
